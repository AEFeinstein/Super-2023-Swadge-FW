# Compatibility

This Python script should be compatible with Python 2 & 3. I have tested it on Windows with Python 3.

# Summary

This Python script polls for USB serial ports which match the VID & PID of an ESP32-S2. When one is found, it will attempt to flash it using `esptool`.

The UI will be green when a Swadge is successfully flashed. It will be red if the flash failed.

# Driver Dependencies

## Windows

Flashing an ESP32-S2 over USB on Windows requires a specific driver to be installed. This driver only needs to be installed once. Instructions can be found in the [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.3/esp32s2/api-guides/dfu.html#usb-drivers-windows-only) and are copied below:

> `dfu-util` uses _libusb_ to access the device. You have to register on Windows the device with the WinUSB driver. Please see the [libusb wiki](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows#How_to_use_libusb_on_Windows) for more details.
>
> The drivers can be installed by the [Zadig tool](https://zadig.akeo.ie/). Please make sure that the device is in download mode before running the tool and that it detects the ESP32-S2 device before installing the drivers. The Zadig tool might detect several USB interfaces of ESP32-S2. Please install the WinUSB driver for only that interface for which there is no driver installed (probably it is Interface 2) and donâ€™t re-install the driver for the other interface.
>
> **Warning**
> The manual installation of the driver in Device Manager of Windows is not recommended because the flashing might not work properly.

## Linux

The ESP-IDF Programming Guide also [specifies a udev rule for Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.3/esp32s2/api-guides/dfu.html#udev-rule-linux-only):

> udev is a device manager for the Linux kernel. It allows us to run `dfu-util` (and `idf.py dfu-flash`) without `sudo` for gaining access to the chip.
> 
> Create file `/etc/udev/rules.d/40-dfuse.rules` with the following content:
> 
>
> ```
> SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="303a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="00??", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"
> ```
> **Note** Please check the output of command `groups`. The user has to be a member of the _GROUP_ specified above. You may use some other existing group for this purpose (e.g. _uucp_ on some systems instead of _plugdev_) or create a new group for this purpose.
> 
> Restart your computer so the previous setting could take into affect or run `sudo udevadm trigger` to force manually udev to trigger your new rule.

# Script Dependencies

This script requires ``python3`` which can be installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

The following Python modules must be installed:
| Module | URL | PIP |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ``tkinter`` | https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html | Tkinter (and, since Python 3.1, ttk, the interface to the newer themed widgets) is included in the Python standard library. | 
| ``pyserial`` | https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html | ```pip install pyserial```| 
| ``esptool`` | https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32s2/installation.html | ```pip install esptool``` |

For the script to actually flash firmware, the following files must be in the same directory as ``pyFlashGui.py``:

| File | Relative Path |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ``bootloader.bin`` | ``../build/bootloader/bootloader.bin`` |
| ``swadge-esp32.bin`` | ``../build/swadge-esp32.bin`` |
| ``partition-table.bin`` | ``../build/partition_table/partition-table.bin`` |
| ``storage.bin`` | ``../build/storage.bin`` |

Assuming you've checked out the whole repository, set up the IDF, and are in the `Super-2023-Swadge-FW` folder, then this should build and place the files:

```bash
idf.py build
cp ./build/bootloader/bootloader.bin ./build/swadge-esp32.bin ./build/partition_table/partition-table.bin ./build/storage.bin ./pyFlashGui/
```

# Instructions

1. Download and install the dependencies
1. Download the final Swadge firmware from the Releases tab: https://github.com/AEFeinstein/Super-2023-Swadge-FW/releases/
1. Run the programmer script (``python3 pyFlashGui.py`` from a terminal)
1. Switch the Swadge's power to USB (right position)
1. Hold the PGM button down (Up on the directional pad)
1. Plug the Swadge into the computer with a USB-C cable
1. Wait for the GUI to flash green, then you're done.
