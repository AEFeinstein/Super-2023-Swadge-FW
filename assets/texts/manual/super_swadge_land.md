# \c540Super Swadge Land\C

\lC\c505_16 levels of conventional 2D platforming action!_\C\L

Make your way across Swadge Land's 16 distinct areas, each full of secrets and danger! Do it with style and see if you can rack up a high score! Seek out the power of Music and Gaming and you might just become unstoppable!

The green LEDs underneath your hands indicate your Hit Points:

Bottom LEDs: 1 HP
Middle LEDs: 2 HP
Top LEDs: 3 (MAX) HP

If you touch an enemy without stomping them from above, you will lose 1 HP. Lose all HP, or fall off the bottom of the screen, and you'll lose a life.

Watch that timer, denoted by "T" in the top right corner of the screen. You guessed it! Lose a life when it reaches 0.

Every level has a Checkpoint Flag. Touch it and you will restart from its location whenever you lose a life.

The shining red Container Blocks hide useful items. Hit them from any direction to release their contents!

Find a "Gaming" or "Music" power-up to increase your HP.

Touch a Warp Vortex and you'll be taken either to a bonus room or to the next part of the level.

Some Container Blocks may be invisible until activated. But you might just uncover a 1UP Heart for finding oneâ€¦

Coins will grant an extra life for each 100 coins collected. Your current coin count is denoted by "C" in the top of the screen.

Brick Blocks can contain anything a Container Block can, but otherwise can be broken from the underside.

Bounce Blocks are just that; they will bounce you forcefully in the opposite direction that you touch them. Hold A while landing on top of them to bounce higher.

When you have max HP, you can press B to fire Squarewave Bolts. They're slightly unwieldy, but can get you out of a bind!

Game over? You can use the "Level Select" option on the title menu to continue from the highest level you've reached.

There are 3 types of enemies that seek your destruction! Each type appears in 3 color variants of varying viciousness.

All enemy types can be defeated by stomping on them from above, zapping them with a Squarewave Bolt, or bumping a Container/Brick/Bounce Block into them.

Most actions you take will advance the score multiplier. Keep the multiplier alive by chaining actions together. This is key to getting a high score.

At the end of each level is a grassy field marked with lines and letter grades. Go for big points at the end of every level by jumping and landing on the area with the best letter grade! Grades range from D (smallest bonus) to A, then Star (huge bonus).
