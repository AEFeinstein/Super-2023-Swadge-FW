# \c540Tiltrads Color\C

\lC\c505_A motion-controlled spin on a classic puzzle game!_\C\L

Fill rows to clear them by aligning falling tetrads. Clear up to 4 rows simultaneously for score bonuses. Tilting the Swadge left and right moves the active tetrad left and right. Pressing A/B rotates the active tetrad. Pressing Down soft-drops the active tetrad, increasing its fall speed. Pressing Up immediately hard-drops and locks in the active tetrad. Soft-dropping and hard-dropping tetrads provide score bonuses. The speed of falling tetrads increases over time. If the board fills up to the point that no new tetrad can be placed, the game is over. Compete for the highest score and last as long as you can!
