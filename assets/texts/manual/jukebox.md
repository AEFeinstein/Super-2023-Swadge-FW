\lC\c505_Listen to your favorite Swadge music and SFX anytime!_\C\L

Once you enter the Jukebox mode, pick either Music or SFX on the menu, and you can get started. Use the Directional Buttons to find that underground theme you liked from Swadge Land, or give a listen to unused and hidden songs!

To entertain your eyes while we entertain your ears, you can pick from a selection of our favorite LED animations from the Light Dances mode.
