# \c540Tunernome: Tuner\C

\lC\c505_A full chromatic tuner, right on your Swadge!_\C\L

The first screen you'll see upon entering Tunernome is the instrument tuner. This can be used to tune a 6-string acoustic guitar, 4-string violin, 4-string ukulele, and 5-string banjo, all in their standard tunings. It can also tune to any of the 12 semitone notes on the chromatic scale individually, or display the most prominent note it can hear.

The notes on the screen correspond to the strings of the guitar, starting from the lowest string at the bottom left and moving clockwise to the highest string. Their positions are matched to the positions of the LEDs, which will light up blue if the associated note is flat, red if the note is sharp, and white if the note is in tune.

Tunernome also helps you keep an accurate tempo and look awesome doing it! This will display the current tempo in BPM (beats per minute) along with the number of beats in a measure.

Every LED flash indicates a single beat (quarter note), with each green LED flash indicating the first beat of each new measure.
