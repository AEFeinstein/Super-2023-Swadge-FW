# \c540Tunernome: Tuner\C

\lC\c505_A full chromatic tuner, right on your Swadge!_\C\L

The first screen you'll see upon entering Tunernome is the instrument tuner. This can be used to tune a 6-string acoustic guitar, 4-string violin, 4-string ukulele, and 5-string banjo, all in their standard tunings. It can also tune to any of the 12 semitone notes on the chromatic scale individually, or display the most prominent note it can hear.

The notes on the screen correspond to the strings of the guitar, starting from the lowest string at the bottom left and moving clockwise to the highest string. Their positions are matched to the positions of the LEDs, which will light up blue if the associated note is flat, red if the note is sharp, and white if the note is in tune.

# \c540Tunernome: Metronome\C

\lC\c505_"Rhythm is just a *click* away!" - osu!_\C\L

Tunernome also helps you keep an accurate tempo and look awesome doing it! This will display the current tempo in BPM (beats per minute) along with the number of beats in a measure.

Every LED flash indicates a single beat (quarter note), with each green LED flash indicating the first beat of each new measure.

# \c540TechnoSlideWhistle\C

\lC\c505_We put a synth. a slide whistle. and fun rhythms in a blender!_\C\L

To make music, tilt your Swadge left and right like a steering wheel or pirate ship wheel and press A. It'll play notes as long as A is held down. You can also touch the Touchpad to play notes instead of tilting and pressing A!

If you press and hold B while playing something, the base note will be held until you release B. Use this to jump from one note or octave to another.

Once you get the hang of it, give some rhythms a try. These play as long as A or the Touchpad is held. Some of them are even arpeggiated.

Cycle through the different musical scales and tempos too, and see what you can create!
\f

# \c540Jukebox\C

# \c540Swadge Bros\C

\lC\c505_MAGFest's All-Stars in an all-out Brawl!_\C\L

Swadge Bros has three main modes: Multiplayer (wireless or wired), VS. CPU, and Home Run Contest.

The controls are the same for all modes. The Directional Buttons move the fighter, the A button jumps, and the B button attacks. The direction of the Directional Buttons influences the attack which is performed. There are five attacks on the ground: neutral, forward tilt, dash, up tilt, and down tilt. There are five more attacks in the air: neutral air, forward air, back air, up air, and down air. During recovery, if a fighter has no jumps left, they will get a bonus ‘ledge jump.'

In the multiplayer modes, either hold two Swadges close to each other to pair wirelessly, or connect two with a USB C-C cable. Once connected, select your fighter. One Swadge, randomly chosen, will select the stage. Duke it out until one fighter is left standing! Records are kept for multiplayer matches.

In VS. CPU, practice against a CPU opponent. You get to pick your fighter, the CPU fighter, and the stage. Records are not kept for VS. CPU matches.

In Home Run Contest, try to whack the Sandbag as far off to the right as you can. Rack up tons of damage and give it a good hit after the stage barrier has dropped! Records are kept for the Home Run Contest.

# \c540Super Swadge Land\C

\lC\c505_16 levels of conventional 2D platforming action!_\C\L

Make your way across Swadge Land's 16 distinct areas, each full of secrets and danger! Do it with style and see if you can rack up a high score! Seek out the power of Music and Gaming and you might just become unstoppable!

The green LEDs underneath your hands indicate your Hit Points:

Bottom LEDs: 1 HP
Middle LEDs: 2 HP
Top LEDs: 3 (MAX) HP

If you touch an enemy without stomping them from above, you will lose 1 HP. Lose all HP, or fall off the bottom of the screen, and you'll lose a life.

Watch that timer, denoted by "T" in the top right corner of the screen. You guessed it! Lose a life when it reaches 0.

Every level has a Checkpoint Flag. Touch it and you will restart from its location whenever you lose a life.

The shining red Container Blocks hide useful items. Hit them from any direction to release their contents!

Find a "Gaming" or "Music" power-up to increase your HP.

Touch a Warp Vortex and you'll be taken either to a bonus room or to the next part of the level.

Some Container Blocks may be invisible until activated. But you might just uncover a 1UP Heart for finding one…

Coins will grant an extra life for each 100 coins collected. Your current coin count is denoted by "C" in the top of the screen.

Brick Blocks can contain anything a Container Block can, but otherwise can be broken from the underside.

Bounce Blocks are just that; they will bounce you forcefully in the opposite direction that you touch them. Hold A while landing on top of them to bounce higher.

When you have max HP, you can press B to fire Squarewave Bolts. They're slightly unwieldy, but can get you out of a bind!

Game over? You can use the "Level Select" option on the title menu to continue from the highest level you've reached.

There are 3 types of enemies that seek your destruction! Each type appears in 3 color variants of varying viciousness.

All enemy types can be defeated by stomping on them from above, zapping them with a Squarewave Bolt, or bumping a Container/Brick/Bounce Block into them.

Most actions you take will advance the score multiplier. Keep the multiplier alive by chaining actions together. This is key to getting a high score.

At the end of each level is a grassy field marked with lines and letter grades. Go for big points at the end of every level by jumping and landing on the area with the best letter grade! Grades range from D (smallest bonus) to A, then Star (huge bonus).

# \c540Donut Jump\C

\lC\c505_Jump your way to a sweet victory!_\C\L

Use the Directional Buttons to move King Donut from block to block to change the blocks' colors. Once all blocks have changed from blue to gold, the round is complete. Build a combo by only jumping on blue blocks without being hit by the Evil Eclair or Devil Donut. Not all blocks are good for landing on, either.

The red blocks are just as devious as the enemies and will cause you to lose a life. The purple blocks will eliminate your combo, but they are also the only spaces that enemies dare not travel.

Keep your eyes open for the Can of Cowabunga, which gives you momentary relief as the enemies won't chase you while it is active. But, be aware they can still harm you if you try and share the same space.

# \c540Pi-Cross\C

\lC\c505_Solve nonogram puzzles and reveal pixel art!_\C\L

Correctly fill in the grid according to the clues. Set all spaces correctly to win and reveal the pixel art!

The numbers to the left of a row are the clue for that row, and the numbers above a column are the clues for that column. Each number in a clue represents a connected series of blocks. There must be at least one gap between the blocks.

Turning on "Guides" in the options menu will tint the selected row/column and show the width or height of the group of blocks the cursor is hovering over, on the right/bottom.

There are also yellow lines every 5 squares to help you count.

Move the blue input square with the d-pad. Press A to toggle spaces as filled. Press B to mark which spaces are empty. Press START to reset the counter (top-left, below the coordinates). Press SELECT to return to the level selection screen and save your progress.

None of the puzzles in pi-cross require guessing in order to solve. The solution can always be logically deduced from the clues, and every puzzle has a single unique solution.
\f

# \c540Flyin Donut\C

\lC\c505_Fly through a reimagined Gaylord Atrium (and collect beans!)_\C\L

Use the up, down, left, and right buttons to pilot the Bean Blaster. The Bean Blaster is a high-energy ship, so it's always moving forward. Pressing the action button will push it even faster, at the cost of maneuverability.

If you don't like the way it's handling, you can invert the Y axis from the main menu.

You must go through all donuts and through the gazebo at the end to complete the Atrium Course. Free Flight mode is also available if you just want to sightsee!
\f

# \c540Tiltrads Color\C

\lC\c505_A motion-controlled spin on a classic puzzle game!_\C\L

Fill rows to clear them by aligning falling tetrads. Clear up to 4 rows simultaneously for score bonuses. Tilting the Swadge left and right moves the active tetrad left and right. Pressing A/B rotates the active tetrad. Pressing Down soft-drops the active tetrad, increasing its fall speed. Pressing Up immediately hard-drops and locks in the active tetrad. Soft-dropping and hard-dropping tetrads provide score bonuses. The speed of falling tetrads increases over time. If the board fills up to the point that no new tetrad can be placed, the game is over. Compete for the highest score and last as long as you can!
