Use the Directional Buttons to move King Donut from block to block to change the blocks' colors. Once all blocks have changed from blue to gold, the round is complete. Build a combo by only jumping on blue blocks without being hit by the Evil Eclair or Devil Donut. Not all blocks are good for landing on, either.

The red blocks are just as devious as the enemies and will cause you to lose a life. The purple blocks will eliminate your combo, but they are also the only spaces that enemies dare not travel.

Keep your eyes open for the Can of Cowabunga, which gives you momentary relief as the enemies won't chase you while it is active. But, be aware they can still harm you if you try and share the same space.
