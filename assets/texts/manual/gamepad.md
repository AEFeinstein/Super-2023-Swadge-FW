Choose your Gamepad type, plug it into a PC or your game console of choice with a USB C-A or C-C cable (not included), and game on! All of the buttons, touch buttons, Touchpad analog value, and accelerometer data are sent to the host PC.

In Switch mode, holding Down and pressing Start is equivalent to pressing the console's â€˜Home' button. Holding Down and pressing Select will capture a screenshot on the console.
