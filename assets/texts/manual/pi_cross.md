Correctly fill in the grid according to the clues. Set all spaces correctly to win and reveal the pixel art!

The numbers to the left of a row are the clue for that row, and the numbers above a column are the clues for that column. Each number in a clue represents a connected series of blocks. There must be at least one gap between the blocks.

Turning on "Guides" in the options menu will tint the selected row/column and show the width or height of the group of blocks the cursor is hovering over, on the right/bottom.

There are also yellow lines every 5 squares to help you count.

Move the blue input square with the d-pad. Press A to toggle spaces as filled. Press B to mark which spaces are empty. Press START to reset the counter (top-left, below the coordinates). Press SELECT to return to the level selection screen and save your progress.

None of the puzzles in pi-cross require guessing in order to solve. The solution can always be logically deduced from the clues, and every puzzle has a single unique solution.
