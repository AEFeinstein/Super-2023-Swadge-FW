\lC\c505_We put a synth. a slide whistle. and fun rhythms in a blender!_\C\L

To make music, tilt your Swadge left and right like a steering wheel or pirate ship wheel and press A. It'll play notes as long as A is held down. You can also touch the Touchpad to play notes instead of tilting and pressing A!

If you press and hold B while playing something, the base note will be held until you release B. Use this to jump from one note or octave to another.

Once you get the hang of it, give some rhythms a try. These play as long as A or the Touchpad is held. Some of them are even arpeggiated.

Cycle through the different musical scales and tempos too, and see what you can create!
