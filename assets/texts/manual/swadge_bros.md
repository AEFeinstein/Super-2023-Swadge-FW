\lC\c505_MAGFest's All-Stars in an all-out Brawl!_\C\L

Swadge Bros has three main modes: Multiplayer (wireless or wired), VS. CPU, and Home Run Contest.

The controls are the same for all modes. The Directional Buttons move the fighter, the A button jumps, and the B button attacks. The direction of the Directional Buttons influences the attack which is performed. There are five attacks on the ground: neutral, forward tilt, dash, up tilt, and down tilt. There are five more attacks in the air: neutral air, forward air, back air, up air, and down air. During recovery, if a fighter has no jumps left, they will get a bonus 'ledge jump.'

In the multiplayer modes, either hold two Swadges close to each other to pair wirelessly, or connect two with a USB C-C cable. Once connected, select your fighter. One Swadge, randomly chosen, will select the stage. Duke it out until one fighter is left standing! Records are kept for multiplayer matches.

In VS. CPU, practice against a CPU opponent. You get to pick your fighter, the CPU fighter, and the stage. Records are not kept for VS. CPU matches.

In Home Run Contest, try to whack the Sandbag as far off to the right as you can. Rack up tons of damage and give it a good hit after the stage barrier has dropped! Records are kept for the Home Run Contest.
