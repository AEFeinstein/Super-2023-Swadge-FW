\lC\c505_Fly through a reimagined Gaylord Atrium (and collect beans!)_\C\L

Use the up, down, left, and right buttons to pilot the Bean Blaster. The Bean Blaster is a high-energy ship, so it's always moving forward. Pressing the action button will push it even faster, at the cost of maneuverability.

If you don't like the way it's handling, you can invert the Y axis from the main menu.

You must go through all donuts and through the gazebo at the end to complete the Atrium Course. Free Flight mode is also available if you just want to sightsee!
