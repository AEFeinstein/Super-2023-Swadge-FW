Holy fricking crap. I want to hug the fox pokémon so goshdang bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I bring her into battle I want to hug her. I've seen literally every SFW fan art post there is of her online. My dreams are nothing but constant cuddling with Braixen. I'm sick of waking up every morning with my pillow in my arms and knowing that I should’ve spent that night hugging Braixen’s soft fox body. I want to feel her warm fur.

Heck, my darn mom caught me with the neighbors dog. I'd dyed her fur orange and black and snuggled with her. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my 3DS. I might not ever get to see Braixen again.
