"Touch grass" is not an insult towards gamers, rather it is advice for them.
When participating in intense periods of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty.
The sweat causes the hand to become slick, and it becomes more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse, thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense gaming moments.
By touching grass with the gamers hand, the grass will impart a layer of particulate onto the gamers hand, the particulate can be made of a variety of dusts, dirts and other natural matter.
This particulate will then act in a similar form to climbers chalk, absorbing the sweat and drying out the gamers hand.
With dry hands, the gamer can now perform to their maximum when gaming.
This is why when an enemy or teammate tells you to touch grass, they are simply trying to assist you in performing better.
