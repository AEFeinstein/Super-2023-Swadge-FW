Here's the thing. You said a "festival is a con."

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a staffer who studies cons, I am telling you, specifically, in MAGFest, no one calls festivals cons. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "con family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Conventidae, which includes things from art shows to job fairs to trade expos.

So your reasoning for calling a festival a con is because random people "call big events cons?" Let's get barbecues and swap meets in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A festival is a festival and a member of the con family. But that's not what you said. You said a festival is a con, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the con family cons, which means you'd call carnivals, raves, and other parties cons, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?
