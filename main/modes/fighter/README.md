# Emulator Input

Emulator input is keyboard-only. 

Software such as [AntiMicroX](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox) can translate joypad input into keyboard keys, which may then be used to control the emulator.

The key map is as follows:

| Button | P1 Key | P2 Key |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Up | `'w'` | `'t'` |
| Down | `'s'` | `'g'` |
| Left | `'a'` | `'f'` |
| Right | `'d'` | `'h'` |
| A | `'l'` | `'m'` |
| B | `'k'` | `'n'` |
| Start | `'o'` | `'y'` |
| Select | `'i'` | `'r'` |
