//A 32-bit version of the DFT used for ColorChord.
//This header makes it convenient to use for an embedded system.
//The 32-bit DFT avoids some bit shifts, however it uses slightly
//more RAM and it uses a lot of 32-bit arithmatic.
//
//This is basically a clone of "ProgressiveIntegerSkippy" and changes
//made here should be backported there as well.

//You can # define these to be other things elsewhere.

// Will used simple approximation of norm rather than
//   sum squares and approx sqrt
